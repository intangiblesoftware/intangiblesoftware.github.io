		<description>We live in a society of instant gratification: instant coffee, instant breakfast, instant money from our local ready bank machine&#8212;it&#8217;s everywhere we look! No wonder so many of us arrive at Al-Anon&#8217;s doors looking for the instant answer to all the problems that come from living with and loving an alcoholic.
Recovery is a process. It takes time to regain, reclaim, and recoup all that was lost while we tried on our own to cope with active drinking. Building trust takes time, change takes time, healing old wounds takes time; there are no immediate, ready-made solutions. But the tools and principles of our program&#8212;&lt;i&gt;Steps, Traditions&lt;&sol;i&gt;, slogans, meetings, sponsorship, service&em-dash;can lead us to the answers that are right for us.
We all have dark times in our lives, but the journey to better times is often what makes us happier, stronger people. When we stop expecting instant relief, we may come to believe that where we are today is exactly where our Higher Power would have us be.</description>
