            <h1><a name="about">About Intangible Software</a></h1>
                <p>It's been good folks! I started Intangible Software back in 2012 as a way to sell my software as I started to get into iOS software development. Since that time I've had several apps in the app store focusing mainly on lacrosse stats-keeping. Lately, my real job has kept me from keeping up with supporting that software. Since I can't, in good conscience, keep selling software I can't maintain, I've removed them from the App Store.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoyed and got good use out of my software, I enjoyed building and using them myself for years. Scroll down to see the portfolio of apps I created and feel free to contact me if you have any questions. </p>
                <p>Take care.</p>
